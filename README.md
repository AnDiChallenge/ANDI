To analyze data for the AnDi competion:

1. Download and unzip the competition datasets (three files named task1.txt, task2.txt and task3.txt) from the AnDi website. Place these files in the directory AnDi.
2. Extract the trajectories using the extract_traj* files.
3. Run the corresponding taskX_Yd_skel.m file where X=task and Y=dim. On running a skel file, the output for each trajectory is saved in the corresponding folder inside the folder named "Submit".
4. The file "format_submit.m" can then be used to combine the results into the format required for the AnDi challenge.
